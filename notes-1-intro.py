# Create our own Chatbot

# 1. Greet the user with a predetermined statement
greeting = "Hello! I am Chatbot."

# 2. Print the statement
print(greeting)

# 3. Introduce the bot
print("My name is MeGPT.")
print("I'm not like the other chatbots.")
print("I'm completely deterministic.")

# 4. Wow the user with some maths

print("I bet you don't know what 8*8 is.")
print("I can do it.")
print(f"8*8 is actually {8*8}.")

print("What is pi squared?")
print("I'm smart and can do it.")
print(f"It is {3.14 **2}.")


# 5. Get the name of the user and store it
user_name = input("So...what's your name?")
print(f"It's nice to meet you, {user_name}.")

food = input(f"{user_name}, what is your favourite food?")
print("Fantastic! That's also one of my favourite food!")

season = input("What is your favourite season?")
print("Wow! I also really enjoy that season!")

hobby = input(f"{user_name}, What is your favourite hobby?")
print("That's fantastic! I think that is a great choice.")

print(f"It's nice to meet you, {user_name}!")
